### 入职培训

**介绍**

Contributors are the lifeblood of any open source project. A project not continually welcoming new
participants might find itself stagnating—or, worse, falling apart.
贡献者是任何开源项目的生命线。一个项目如果不去不断地欢迎新的参与者，可能会发现自己停滞不前，或者更糟糕————项目会分崩离析。

So any open source project desiring long-term sustainability should think seriously about the ways
it connects with, greets, and acclimates—in a word, how it "onboards"—new contributors. A well-
designed onboarding process makes contributing to your project easier for participants, and it
empowers contributors to positively impact the the work as quickly as possible.
因此，任何希望长期持续发展的开源项目都应该认真考虑它与新贡献者的联系、迎接和适应的方式———— 一句话，他们是如何 "上岗"的。一个精心设计的入职过程会使参与者更容易为项目做出贡献，并使贡献者能够尽快对工作产生积极影响。

In this chapter, we’ll discuss the importance of your community’s onboarding experience and
examine some common onboarding resources and practices that may help your project become
more sustainable.
在这一章中，我们将讨论你的社区的入职过程的重要性，并研究一些常见的入职资源和做法，这可能有助于你的项目变得更加可持续。


**The importance of an onboarding experience**
**入职体验的重要性**

In many ways, the experience of onboarding in a new open source community is much like one you
might have in a new job.
在许多方面，在一个新的开源社区中的入职体验与你在一份新工作中的体验非常相似。

For example, when you begin working in a new position (or in an entirely new organization), you’ll
need to become familiar with new people, new tools, new processes, new norms, new policies, and
more. And you’ll likely feel motivated to do these things quickly, because you’re eager to
demonstrate your value to the organization and become comfortable in your new environment so
you can do your best work. The faster you feel like you’re making an impact, the more likely you
are to stick around. And the more satisfied you’ll be.
例如，当你开始在一个新的职位（或在一个全新的组织）工作时，你需要熟悉新的人、新的工具、新的流程、新的规范、新的政策，等等。而你很可能会觉得自己有动力快速完成这些事情，因为你渴望向组织展示你的价值，并在新环境中变得舒适，这样你就可以在最佳状况做你的工作。你越快感觉到自己正在产生影响，你就越有可能留在这里。而你也会越发满意。

But you may also be joining a team with an extensive history—shared norms and customs, in-jokes,
jargon, unspoken agreements, shared bonds, and a sense of collective identity. In short, your new
team or organization will have a culture that pre-exists and pre-dates your joining it. Facets of this
culture are largely intangible, but they’ll significantly affect your ability to collaborate with others.
An effective onboarding experience equips you to understand this culture.
但是，你也可能加入一个有着广泛历史的团队--共同的规范和习俗、内部笑话、行话、不言而喻的协议、共同的纽带和集体认同感。简而言之，你的新团队或组织会有一种在你加入之前就存在的文化。这种文化的各个方面在很大程度上是无形的，但它们会大大影响你与他人合作的能力。一个有效的入职体验能让你了解这种文化。

All of this remains true of onboarding experiences in open source communities. In particular, open
source communities present onboarding challenges like:
所有这些在开源社区的入职经历中都是如此。特别是，开放源码社区在入职方面的挑战包括

**An asynchronous and remote environment**
**异步远程环境**

```
One of the great perks of a traditional office environment is that you are close to your co-
workers and managers for face to face interactions and you can find them for quick questions.
In contrast, when you join a new open source community, you will likely work with community
members in different georgraphies and time zones. So unless there are good onboarding
materials such as documentation, video tutorials, wiki pages, and other resources, it’s going to
be more challenging to get started in open source communties even for experienced self starters.
```
```
传统办公环境的一大好处是，你可以通过快速找到他们并提问，与同事和经理进行面对面的交流。相反，当你加入一个新的开源社区时，您你能会与不同地理位置和时区的社区成员一起工作。因此，除非有好的入门材料，如文档、视频教程、wiki页面和其他资源，否则即使对于有经验的自启动者来说，在开源社区起步也将更具挑战性。
```

**Imposter syndrome**
**冒充者综合症**

```
When it’s more difficult to get real time help or feedback, people can easily get stuck with simple
tools issues and feel less confident about their work. So a good onboarding experience in open
source communities is crucial for newcomers not to feel discouraged in their early days in the
community.
```
当获得实时帮助或反馈比较困难时，人们很容易被简单的工具问题困住，且对自己的工作感到不自信。因此，在开源社区中，良好的入职体验对于新人在社区的早期不感到气馁是至关重要的。

**Significant variability**
**显著可变性**

```
No two open source communities are the same. Even for seasoned open source contributors,
when they join a new community they will need to get familiar with new tools, new processes,
and even new terminologies. Depending on the community, seemingly simple terms like
contributions, community members, projects, upstream, etc. may mean something slightly
different and can easily cause confusion for new community members.
```

没有哪两个开源社区是相同的。即使是经验丰富的开源贡献者，当他们加入一个新的社区时，也需要熟悉新的工具、新的流程，甚至是新的术语。根据不同的社区，像贡献、社区成员、项目、上游等这些看似简单的术语，其含义都可能略有不同，很容易给新的社区成员带来困惑。

**Onboarding basics**
**入职基础**

As you work to make your project’s onboarding process and experience most effective, ask yourself
these questions:

当你努力使你的项目的入职过程和体验最有效时，问自己这些问题：

- What can people contribute to the project?
- 人们能为项目做出什么贡献？
- Where do people contribute to the project?
- 人们在哪里为项目做出贡献？
- How do people contribute to the project?
- 人们如何为项目做出贡献？

Answering the first question about your project’s onboarding process requires a good deal of work.
Incoming contributors need to know what would be the most helpful contributions they could
make. Quite a few projects have set up tagging on their source code repositories for "first-time
contributors" or something similar, which is an excellent way to direct incoming contributors to
solving issues and bugs while also introducing newcomers to the source material of the project.
回答关于你的项目入职过程的第一个问题需要做大量的工作。新来的贡献者需要知道什么是他们可以做出的最有用的贡献。相当多的项目在他们的源代码库中设置了 "首次贡献者" 或类似的标签，这是引导新来的贡献者解决问题和错误的一个很好的方法，同时也向新人介绍了项目的原始资料。

The second question—regarding "where to contribute"—is one that projects don’t pose as often as
you’d think. Project veterans might dismissively say, "what you need is on the forums" or "read the
wiki if you need more detail." But in which specific repository are the material available? Under
what organization? And what about other, similarly named projects? Ensure your project website
features clear links to places where new contributors can make an impact on the project. These
links shouldn’t be buried, either; they should be right on the home page, if possible.
第二个问题--关于 "在哪里贡献"-- 这是一个项目里并不像你想象的那样经常提出的问题。一些项目老手可能会不屑一顾地说，"你需要的东西在论坛上"或 "如果你需要更多的细节，请去阅读wiki"。但是，在哪个具体的资源库里有这些材料？在什么组织下？还有其他类似的项目呢？确保你的项目网站有明确的链接，让新的贡献者能够对项目产生影响。这些链接也不应该被埋没；如果可能的话，它们应该就在主页上。


Third is the question of "how to contribute." Too often, projects release their source code, even
make it easily discoverable... and that’s it. You may have heard others refer to this approach as
"throwing it over the wall," and it is not a phrase people tend to use politely. Too many projects will
push their code or content into a public place, declare it open to all, and then wonder where all the
contributors are. This can be because there is a real barrier to entry, in the lack of documentation


and procedures for getting contributions into the project.

Next, let’s discuss discuss some resources and practices your project can use to eliminate these
barriers and streamline your project’s onboarding process.
第三个问题是“如何贡献”的问题。项目经常发布源代码，来使其易于发现。。。就这样。你可能听说过其他人把这种方法称为“把它扔到墙上”，而这不是一个人们倾向于礼貌地使用的短语。太多的项目会将其代码或内容推到公共场所，宣布对所有人开放，然后想知道所有可能的贡献者都在哪里。这可能是因为在项目中缺乏获得贡献的文件和程序，且存在真正的进入障碍。

接下来，让我们讨论一下你的项目可以使用的一些资源和实践，以消除这些障碍并简化项目的入职流程。

**Onboarding resources**
**入职资源**

A key tool (and practice) for working successfully in an asynchronous environment is good
documentation. Since contributors won’t typically have fellow community members available near
them to provide impromptu guidance, it’s important to have important community norms,
decisions, and processes well-documented in much more detail than they might be in a more
traditionl work environment. Whether it’s a landing page, project documentation, wiki page, etc., a
good set of references are crucial for new community members to get familiar with the community
and get started. It’s also important to ensure that the onboarding documentations are up to date
and reflect the latest snapshot of the community’s activity, so you want to make it easy for anyone
to help keeping the contents up to date. An easy-to-use documentation tool definitely helps with
this, but what’s more important is to cultivate a community culture that impresses on everyone the
need for reliable, updated documentation.
在异步环境中成功工作的一个关键工具（和实践）是良好的文档。由于贡献者通常不会有社区成员在他们附近提供指导，所以重要的是要把重要的社区规范、决定和流程记录下来，而且要比在更传统的工作环境中更详细。无论是登陆页面、项目文档、维基页面等，一套好的参考资料对于新的社区成员熟悉社区并开始工作至关重要。确保入职文件是最新的，反映社区活动的最新快照也很重要，所以你要让任何人都能轻松地帮助保持内容的更新。一个易于使用的文档工具肯定有助于此，但更重要的是培养一种社区文化，让每个人都明白需要可靠、更新的文档。

This may sound obvious, but another key resource for onboarding is other community members.
Even if people do not sit in the same office, having access to experienced community members to
help people get started and answer questions can help alleviate the sense of isolation in the early
days. Something simple like onboarding buddies who can jump on a welcome call may be enough
for a small community that is relatively new. For larger and more established communities, people
may have seen working groups focused on onboarding or even community members with formal
titles such as coaches or mentors.
这可能听起来很显而易见————入职培训的另一个关键资源是其他社区成员。即使人们不在同一个办公室，但能够接触到有经验的社区成员，帮助人们开始工作并回答问题，也可以帮助缓解早期的孤独感。对于一个相对较新的小型社区来说，一些简单的方式，比如可以接到欢迎电话的入职伙伴可能就足够了。。对于更大和更成熟的社区，你可能会见到专注于入职培训的工作小组，甚至是有正式头衔的社区成员，如教练或导师。

Once people resoures for onboarding are in place, this information (especially on who to reach out
for help) needs to be posted in multiple places so that people feel welcome to contact their
onboarding resources and feel encouraged to ask questions. If getting help is difficult, new comers
will feel discouraged from engaging with the community and even decide that the community may
not be for them afterall.
一旦人们的入职资源到位，这些信息（尤其是关于向谁寻求帮助的信息）需要在多个地方发布，这样人们就会因为联系与他们的入职资源感到欢迎，并感到被鼓励去问问题。如果获得帮助很困难，新来的人就会对参与社区活动感到气馁，甚至决定这个社区可能不适合他们。

Whether it’s onboarding buddies, mentors, working groups, etc., you want to have a large enough
pool of volunteers so that these volunteers don’t feel burned out with onboarding activities
especially as the community grows. What is important is to have a culture within the community so
that there is an expectation on everyone to help welcome new community members. Ideally, what
we want to see is a lot of people volunteering to help others whether or not they have a formal title
as a coach or a mentor. If you have a formal program for onboarding working group, mentors, etc.,
you should not set a high barrier to entry for community members to become an official
onboarding resource. The most important qualification should be people’s willingness to help
others versus other factors such as their tenure in the community or technical expertise in the
project. The people who are helping with onboarding do not need to have all the answers. Rather,
they need to help newcomers find answers quicker and not work alone.
无论是入职伙伴、导师、工作小组等，你都应该希望有足够多的志愿者，这样这些志愿者就不会因为入职活动而感到疲惫，特别是随着社区的发展，在社区内形成一种文化，使每个人都有帮助欢迎新社区成员的期望。理想情况下，我们希望看到的是很多人自愿帮助他人，无论他们是否有教练或导师的正式称号。如果你有一个正式的入职工作组、导师等项目，你不应该为社区成员成为正式的入职资源设置高门槛。最重要的资格应该是人们帮助他人的意愿，而不是其他因素，如他们在社区的任期或项目的技术专长。帮助入职的人不需要有所有的这些东西。相反，他们需要帮助新人更快找到答案，而不是让新人独自工作。

**Onboarding practices**
**入职实践**

When people join a new community, they may find following discussions on communication
channels (such as mailing lists or Slack) to be overwhelming. To alleviate their confusion or stress,


consider creating spaces in these channels specifically for new community members to use as they
get started and acclimated. For example, dedicated channels such as "getting started" or
"introductions" can be good places for people to feel safe asking newcomer questions. These
channels also allow more experienced community members to assist with onboarding by helping
answer newscomer questions or even simply by offering encouragement. It all goes a long way to
making new community members feel welcome as they’re getting started.

Once new community members feel oriented and comfortable enough to begin contributing to an
open source project, their next questions will be "Where can I contribute?"
当人们加入一个新的社区时，他们可能会发现在交流渠道（如邮件或Slack）上的讨论让人不知所措。为了减轻他们的困惑或压力，可以考虑在这些频道中为新的社区成员创造空间，让他们在开始和适应的时候使用。例如，诸如 "入门 "或 "介绍 "这样的专用频道可以成为为人们提供安全感的地方，以便新成员提问。这些频道也允许更多有经验的社区成员通过帮助回答新用户的问题，甚至只是提供鼓励来协助入职。这对使新的社区成员在开始时感到受欢迎有很大的帮助。

一旦新的社区成员觉得自己有足够的能力开始为一个开源项目做出贡献，他们的下一个问题将是 "我在哪里可以做出贡献？"

So to help newcomers get started, you may wish to develop a list of work items that new
community members in particular can tackle. Many communities label issues in their issue trackers
with something like "good for first time contributors," "good first issue," or "help wanted," so
newscomers can more easily identify tasks with which they can help immediately. Issues with these
labels could range from documentation errors, easy bug fixes, or other simple tasks that will help
new contributors experience early successes and therefore build their confidence. Having a contact
person (or people) servinvg as mentors or coaches listed on these issues (in case people need help
getting started) can also be helpful. Always remember: Issues that may seem simple to experienced
community members might not be as simple for newcomers.
因此，为了帮助新来的人开始工作，你应该制定一份工作清单，特别是新来的社区成员可以处理的工作项目。以及社区成员可以处理的工作项目。许多社区在他们的issue（译者注：问题追踪器）中给问题贴上标签，如 "适合首次贡献者"、"好的第一个issue "或 "需要帮助"，这样新成员可以更容易地确定他们可以立即提供帮助的任务。标签的范围可以是文档错误、简单的错误修复，或其他简单的任务，这些任务将帮助新的贡献者体验早期的成功，从而建立他们的信心。在这些问题上列出一个（或几个）作为导师或教练的联系人（以备人们需要帮助时）也是有帮助的。永远记住：对有经验的社区成员来说可能很简单的问题，对他们来说可能不那么简单。

Many open source communities organize events aimed at connecting their members. Whether the
events are collocated or virtual, they provide excellent opportunities for community members to
collaborate synchronously—and get to know each other in the process. These events could be
summits, hackathons, user confernces, etc. At these events, consider creating special programming
or spaces for new community members. You might organize formal orientation sessions as a "Day
0" event if your budget allows for it, or a lunchtime session at which newcomers can meet other
community members so they know who they can ask questions to later on.
许多开源社区组织活动旨在联系他们的成员。无论这些活动是在同一地点还是虚拟的，它们都为社区成员提供了同步合作的绝佳机会，并在这个过程中相互了解。这些活动可以是峰会、黑客马拉松、用户会议等。在这些活动中，可以考虑为新的社区成员创造特殊的程序或空间。
如果你的预算允许，你可以组织正式的迎新会，作为一个 "day 0" 活动，或者在午餐时间组织迎新会，让新成员认识其他社区成员，这样他们就知道以后可以向谁提问了。

**Contributor pathways**
**贡献途径**

Once new contributors have made their initial contributions to your project, they’ll begin looking
for ways to make more significant impacts. To do this, they’ll often look for ways they can apply
their specific skills and talents to the project.
一旦新的贡献者对你的项目做出了初步贡献，他们会开始寻找方法来产生更重要的影响。为了做到这一点，他们通常会寻找可以将自己的特定的具体技能和才干用于在项目中的应用。

Opportunities for volunteers to begin lending their unique talents to an open source project are
called that project’s "contributor pathways." The greater the number of contributor pathways your
project features, the more likely it is to recruit participants with the various skills required for the
project’s success.
志愿者开始为一个开源项目提供他们独特的才能的机会被称为该项目的 "贡献者途径"。你的项目有越多的贡献者途径，就越有可能招募到具有项目成功所需的各种技能的参与者。

Your project will have any number of contributor pathways specific to it, but these pathways will
generally fall into two basic categories: pathways with a community focus and those with a
technical focus.
你的项目会有任何数量的特定贡献者途径，但这些途径一般会分为两个基本类别：以社区为重点的途径和以技术为重点的途径。

_Community-focused_ pathways are opportunities for contribution that may not require specialized
technical knowledge on the part of participants. These are pathways focused on helping new
contributors document the project, raise awareness of and market the project, plan community
meetings and events, etc.—all extraordinarily important aspects of a project’s eventual success.
Examples include:


1. Documenting workflow and governance processes
2. Onboarding and mentoring new members
3. Localizing content into various languages
4. Copywriting (for website, newsletters, blogs)
5. Managing social media
6. Organizing events

_Technically focused_ contributor pathways, on the other hand, are contributions requiring
specialized knowledge of software development (often in a particular computing language). These
pathways are focused on enchancing or refining the body of software a community maintains.
Examples include:

1. Adding new features and documentation
2. Fixing existing bugs and triaging issues
3. Refactoring existing work to improve it
4. Performing quality assurance
5. Improving user interface and user experience
6. Release engineering
7. Creating and maintaining project roadmap
8. Code and user interface localization

When assessing your project’s contributor pathways, ask yourself: Does your project currently offer
new (and existing) contributors opportunities to contribute rewardingly to (or even take ownership
of ) work in each of these areas? If not, one general way to begin expanding your project is by
making concerted efforts to formalize, refine, document, and advertise these contributor pathways.

We call these "pathways" because they allow participants to deepen investment in the community
_gradually_ so they don’t feel overwhelemed and can acclimate themselves to the project’s processes
and culture as they become more involved. Ideally, as your community matures, it will construct
pathways that incrementally confer more responsibility and authority on contributors.
Contributors following your project’s contributor pathway related to events, for example, probably
won’t get started by taking sole responsibility for your community’s flagship annual event. But they
might work with experienced community members on planning that event, taking charge of
securing a venue, advertising, registration, and more.
