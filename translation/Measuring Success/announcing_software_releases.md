### 宣发软件

**介绍**

One of any open source project’s functions is releasing software with the goal of reaching as many
users as possible. To help projects succeed, you’ll need to ensure that you distribute news of your
release in a timely fashion, to the widest relevant audience, and with the right information.
任何开源项目的功能之一就是宣发软件，目的是让尽可能多的用户了解。为了帮助项目成功，你需要确保及时向最广泛的相关受众发布你的发行消息，并提供正确的信息。

Following some basic guidelines for coordinating release announcements can ensure that your
excellent work doesn’t get lost in the shuffle. Remember that these are only guides; you
community’s practices may differ.
遵循一些发布公告的基本准则，可以确保你出色的工作不会在一片混乱中被浪费。记住，这些只是指南；你所在社区的做法可能有所不同。

**一般准则**

- Do not set any release date for a Friday or significant holiday. The ideal release date for
    maximum coverage is Tuesday.
- 不要为周五或重要假日设定任何发布日期。覆盖面最大的理想发布日期是星期二。
- If at all possible, coordinate major releases with relevant conferences and events.
- 如果可能的话，请将重大发布与相关会议和活动相协调。
- Tailor release announcements and blogs to encourage both _use_ of the software as well as
    _contributions_ to it.
- 定制发布公告和博客，以鼓励对软件的使用以及对其的贡献。
- Talk about how a project benefits the user; explain benefits rather than focusing on technical
    details.
- 讲述一个项目如何为用户带来益处；而不是专注于技术细节。

**Track: Release candidate and final release for major point release X.0**

Follow or adapt this process for a major point release (X.0):

**After all major releases and significant point releases**

1. Conduct a retrospective to see what, if anything, could be done to improve the next release
    cycle.

**Writing a press release/release announcement**

Writing and distributing a release announcement would seem relatively straightforward; however,
some strategies for doing this work are more effective than others. Specifically, you should write
your release announcement in a way that makes it most likely for a media outlet to pick it up.

Below is a template for a release announcement, with some guidelines. Please note that this is only
a guide; copying exactly what’s here may not be effective for your project.

Be direct and factual about information you share in public statements. Avoid hyperbole ("the
bestest project ever made!!!") and speculation ("the only project that can do this"). Media outlets
rapidly disregard such hyperbole and might avoid spreading the word about your release
altogether.


Release announcements are not opportunities to hype your project (as tempting as using them for
this purpose may be). You can and should take the opportunity to thank your hard-working
community. This gives credit to those who’ve done the work and emphasizes the free and open
source nature of the project.

Be clear and concise. Support your claims with facts. This will help get your announcement more
broadly disseminated.
